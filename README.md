# To-do
- [ ] Validate headers -- register and unregister [Reference](https://community.jivesoftware.com/docs/DOC-99941#jive_content_id_Ensure_Register_Calls_are_Coming_from_a_Genuine_Jive_Instance)
- [ ] Validate signed fetch add-on requests [Reference](https://community.jivesoftware.com/docs/DOC-156557)
- [ ] Examples Framework [Reference](https://community.jivesoftware.com/docs/DOC-99941)
  - [ ] Tile (with **/jive/tile/register** and **/jive/tile/unregister** endpoints)

  - [ ] Add-On (with configure screen and **/jive/addon/register** and **/jive/tile/unregister** endpoints)
- [ ] Documentation (include method defintions in README.md)

#Testing Validation
Test your encoded secret with a known output by CURLing the payload below to the registration endpoint.
  
  **Sample Payload:**
```
{  
  "clientId": "i5j15eikcd5u2xntgk5zu4lt93zkgx6z.i",
  "clientSecret": "7wmyigctxbopc22jo7u4xorxsn2m9r04.s",
  "code": "nki1dxrtl3r2q3kkgorwfkrmik234ppw.c",
  "scope": "uri:/api",
  "jiveUrl": "http://ws-z0-120493.jiveland.com:8080",
  "jiveSignature": "dtuW522kpoayRLFkPq6l3MOXxoKwfyNHsgGMlitr9PM=",
  "jiveSignatureURL": "https://market.apps.jivesoftware.com/appsmarket/services/rest/jive/instance/validation/29c38d1a-9c8a-4ec5-9b55-56fc44a5a402",

```

**ClientSecret Hex Digest Output**:
