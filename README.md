# jive-sdk-go
This is currently a placeholder for a series tools to assist Go developers to build Jive Add-Ons.   Reach out in the Jive Developer Community if you are interested in contributing.

**This SDK is currently a work in progress.  As I get time, I will continue to try and update this along with the other example languages.  Feel free to contribute =)**
