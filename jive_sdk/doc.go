/*
 This is a Jive Add-On example project implemented in Go.  It is open-source and contributions are welcome.  This is *NOT* an official Jive product, but rather a reference implementation.

 In this repo, you will find:
 	./jive_addon - An example service to back a Jive Add-On.  This will be your primary development folder.
 	./examples - Sample go code projects that are relevant/helpful.  
 			Note:  Any examples prefixed with "jive" will be jive specific examples
 	./jive_sdk - Location of the basic SDK components for use in the Add-On example.  Unless you are contributing to the project, you shouldn't need to mess with this folder.
 
 For questions about this project, please reach out in the Jive Developer Community.
